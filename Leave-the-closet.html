    <h1>You leave the janitor's closet, leaving the other you inside.</h1>
    <p>You turn around as the door shuts and wonder what the actual heck is going on. Are you going crazy? You open the janitor's closet door again and find that the other you is gone. You begin to wonder what would have happened had you not followed the instructions correctly. Then you think "too bad this isn't a made up story where you could do exactly that." You head back to the library and continue on with your life.</p>
    <h2>Congratulations! You successfully survived the collapse of your universe and have reached the end of the story!</h2>
    <h3>The end</h3>
