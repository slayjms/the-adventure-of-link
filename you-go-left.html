    <h1>You go left</h1>
    <p>Your eyes scan both sides of the hallway looking for what might resemble a door leading to a janitor's closet. You reach the end of the hallway, but it continues down to the left. You wonder if it could be down this next hallway, or if you turn around it would be down the other end of the hallway you just came down. You remember how hard it is to make decisions when you're on a timer.</p>
