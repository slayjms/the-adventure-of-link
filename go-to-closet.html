    <h1>You don't waste any time and head out of the library.</h1>
    <p>Your breath quickens as you check your watch and wonder if the time limit has already started. You panic and realize you're not even sure where the nearest janitor's closet even is. It has been ages since you've even been in this school building. Your pace quickens as you head down the hall, passing people on the way. Soon you reach the end of the hallway.</p>
